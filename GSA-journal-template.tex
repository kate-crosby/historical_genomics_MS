\section*{Introduction}

\lettrine[lines=2]{\color{color2}M}{}aize is a staple crop in the United States making up X agriculture acres and producing X weight in animal feed. 
Maize yields (a fitness proxy) in the United States have increased in terms of total numbers since the late 1800s, but have largely slowed in terms of growth rate since the influx of new adaptive material in the mid 1950s to early 1970s. As growth rate in fitness is generally correlated with the amount of available adaptive genetic diversity 
Total decrease in heterozygosity amongst and within heterotic breeding pools (cite Gerke - maybe give more of an example here) of modern maize, suggests that genetic diversity is lower than it once was. 
If much of the diversity that has been lost is adaptive, then present day lines would have less variation available to respond to various selection regimes imposed by breeders. 
If diversity has indeed been lost over time, and has not been recouped by the introgression of new material or mutational input, then what is the composition of this lost genetic diversity? Previous studies suggest that \kc{find lit. on this}...
\jri{note in gerke paper that haplotypes fixed (presumably under selection) not found in lines derived from those cycles, suggesting perhaps that adaptive haps have been lost.}
If the loss is largely composed of deleterious or neutral alleles, then the loss is not of concern to farmers and breeders. 
If this loss contains even a small amount of beneficial/adaptive alleles, this would mean that the efficacy of selection on modern maize lines would suffer as time went on. 
This is because, save for the inputs of novel variation in the 1950s when heterotic breeding pools were originally formed - there has not been much in terms of inputs from novel maize material save for... \kc{cite tropical introgression for blight stuff}.


The "inbred-hybrid" selection method for propagating and distributing maize hybrids has been in use for over 100 years in many breeding platforms and programs in the United States. 
This method typically (but not always) selects on inbred "general combining ability" to produce a vigorous and viable hybrid, which is then grown by farmers. These breeding programs may also apply selective agents (drought, disease) to further evaluate combining ability of inbreds.
The loss of heterosis or "hybrid breakdown" then occurs in the next generation, with a loss in fitness/yield.
Phenotypic selection by breeders using mapping populations was a common practice prior to the advent of molecular markers. 
While past studies have found signatures of selection in modern maize: list (cite,cite,cite) these studies have largely fallen short in finding signatures of soft selection and the polygenic basis of likely many traits under the influence of selection. 
Large effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) and SNPs at these loci are generally markers that are consistently observed to be associated with traits across or within environments. 
However, the genetic basis of most adaptive traits is likely to be polygenic in nature affected by many alleles of small effect \kc{cite examples Doebley, etc Rockman review, Yeaman et al 2015}. We attempt to apply a new method to isolate this signature of polygenic adaptation to our panel of inbred lines

We focus narrowly on an inbred line's year release date to pinpoint these signatures of selection through time (compare and contrast with Joost) within a heterotic group or genetic cluster as past studies have failed to account for population structure, which may influence a study's power to detect selection \kc{explain the concept of heterotic group or breeding pool above?}. 



\section*{Materials and Methods}

In order to examine selection through time we obtained the exact release dates of 823 public maize inbred lines, using a variety of sources including: Gerdes and Tracy, the USDA database, original line release sheets, or communication with maize breeding experts. Many dates in the USDA although categorized as "Year Released" are the year that the line was acquired. 
The release date indicates the year that line was released to breeders in order to propagate hybrids.
First we grouped inbred lines according to their broad genetic cluster (or 'heterotic group') using principal components analysis (PCA) using the approach described in  \kc{cite plos one G Abraham} or \textit{flashpca} \kc{give githubrepo}. 
This approach is robust to missing SNP data, and is computationally fast for large datasets.  
Maize inbred lines within a broad heterotic group were then dated by year of release, any inbred line without a year of release affiliated with it was discarded from further analysis.



\subsection*{Statistical Analysis} 
To isolate signals of selection and local adaptation within each genetic cluster of maize inbreds, we used BayEnv2, which estimates Bayes factors ($\beta$), which broadly approximate the parameter $Ns$ (population size and selection coefficient).
We estimated the neutral covariance matrix of a subset of polymorphic GBS markers within each genetic cluster. We chose a multiple of the subset of the total GBS markers by chromosome. Given that there was approximately 1 marker/1 Mb \kc{orwhatever} these markers are at the very least not cis-linked, which is key to estimating the covariance matrix \kc{basically I took a medium factor of the total length of each cluster - so every 25th -50th marker, it's not random, that's the point - it minimizes LD}. 
The covariance matrix is used to estimate a neutral (drift) model of evolution across environments, in this case temporal environments. 
Thus, any Bayes Factor for a SNP that deviate substantially from expected neutral frequencies has potentially experienced and responded to selection in the past 60-70 years.  While there is no strict significance cut-off, large $\beta$s for many SNPs in the same genomic region indicate past selection.
Each inbred line with a release year within a cluster was effectively treated as a population, and while this approach has not been attempted in the literature, it deals directly with the issue of population structure. 

The second approach effectively scans the genome for signals of polygenic adaptation of quantitative traits. This method termed ``$Q_x$'', is first described in \citep{berg2014population} and is a novel, multi-variate approach that extends from the univariate $Q_{ST}$ and $F_{ST}$ tests for selection and adaptation \kc{Latta 1998, reviewed in McKay and Latta 2002}. 
As this approach is relatively new, we describe our approach below.
First, GWAS hits (SNP effect sizes) in a mapping population are used to pinpoint SNPs in the genome that significantly contribute to additive genetic variation $V_A$ in quantitative traits, the frequency of those SNPs that have is calculated in the mapping panel. 
Second, using a reference population, the frequencies of those matching SNPs are also calculated. 
Neutral evolution, like in BayEnv is modelled using a covariance matrix of randomly sampled markers to build a multivariate distribution (simulating the genomic background), and this is generally how the method differs from $Q_{ST}$-$F_{ST}$ approaches.
If those SNPs are at higher frequency in the reference panel than what is expected under the multivariate distribution (the genomic background), then .
In the univariate scenario (for a given quantitative trait), divergent selection or local adaptation are processes that typically lead to $Q_{ST}$ values > $F_{ST}$ values for both neutral markers and QTLs.
$Q_x$ is a statistic produced for all pops. 
not different from that expected given GWAS effect sizes and observed allele frequencies given a neutral covariance matrix (simulated from allel

We performed tests within each genetic cluster

Our final approach used a more recent version of \kc{Nielsen} of finding the signature of positive selection using SWeeD
